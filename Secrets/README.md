#### Secret1: How to play subsribers levels

You can see the pass code of any level and any user, if you know the session of the game. 
So if you tipe /play/level/\<level#1 name\>?session=\<session of level#1\> - you can see how the player passed it. 

You can see even subscribers levels, if somebody give you that link(1).

If the session belongs to you, than you can edit the code, as you always do(2).

You can use session from level#1 to another level#2, than you see how charaster in level#2 act as he is like in the level#1(3).

So using (1)+(2)+(3):
We can use our own session to see and pass the subscriber level if we type
/play/level/\<subscriber level\>?session=\<our session from not subscriber level\>

<i>*You would not get any reward. You can pass the subscriber level only for your pleasure.</i>
